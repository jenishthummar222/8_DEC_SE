                        ******** THEORY EXERCISE: ********
            o Explain the basic structure of a C program, including headers, main function, 
              comments, data types, and variables. Provide examples. 

==========================================================================================

Strucure of C langauge

1] Documentation of program
    -> which is represent your program's title or description.
    -> which is represent by comments.
    -> Compiler skip or ignore comments at executation time.

    ** there are two type of comments **

        i) Single line comment : which is represent by //

            e.g.  // this is single line comment.
        
        ii) Multi line comment : which is represent by /*....*/ 

            e.g /* this is 
                    multi line 
                    comments
                */

2] Connection with c langauge libary

    #include<stdio.h>
    #include<conio.h>

        hear, 
            # :-> which is predefined
            include :-> to add somthing
            <stdio.h> :->" standard input output header file. "
                        using of this header file we can acess inbuilt function from this file
            <conio.h> :-> console input output header file. 

3] executation of program
    void main()
    {
        ...
    }
        hear,
            void  : it is a data type which is dose not return value.
            main  :- it is a function which represent that this a main executatable of program.
            {...} :- this is represent block of code.

Example :-

    // Print number on console      -> It's comments
    #include <stdio.h>  //          -> c langauge libary

    void main() {       //          -> Main function 

        int num; //                 -> data type with variable diclaretion
        num = 10; //                -> variable initlization
        printf("%d",num);//         -> print variable value in console.
    }
