                        ******** LAB EXERCISE: ********
            o Research and provide three real-world applications where C programming is 
            extensively used, such as in embedded systems, operating systems, or game 
            development.

==========================================================================================

1. Embedded Systems

    -> C programming is the most widely used language in embedded systems. Embedded systems are 
       specialized computer systems designed to perform specific tasks within larger systems.

    ** Real-world examples

        -> Microcontrollers (Arduino, PIC, AVR, ARM)

        -> Washing machines, microwave ovens

        -> Automotive systems (engine control units, airbags, ABS)

        -> Medical devices (ECG machines, infusion pumps)

        -> IoT devices and smart sensors

    ** Why C is used

       -> Direct access to hardware and memory

       -> Very fast execution speed

       -> Requires low memory, ideal for resource-constrained devices

       -> Easy to write low-level drivers and firmware

       -> Because embedded systems often have limited RAM and processing power, 
          C is preferred over high-level languages.


2. Operating Systems and System Software

    -> C plays a critical role in operating system development. 
    -> Most modern operating systems are either fully or partially written in C.

    ** Real-world examples

        -> UNIX (originally written in C)

        -> Linux kernel

        -> Windows kernel (partially)

        -> macOS and iOS core components

        -> Device drivers and system utilities

    ** Why C is used

        -> Provides low-level control over CPU, memory, and processes

        -> Highly portable across different hardware platforms

        -> Produces efficient and reliable machine code

        -> Ideal for writing kernels, schedulers, and memory managers

        -> Without C, modern operating systems would not achieve the required performance and stability.


3. Game Development and Graphics Engines

    -> C is heavily used in game engines and performance-critical parts of games, 
       especially where speed and efficiency are essential.

    ** Real-world examples

        -> Game engines like Unity (core parts) and Unreal Engine (via C/C++)

        -> 2D and 3D game engines

        -> Physics engines and rendering engines

        -> Console and PC games

    ** Why C is used

        -> High performance for graphics rendering and physics calculations

        -> Better control over memory management

        -> Efficient use of system resources

        -> Works closely with graphics APIs like OpenGL and DirectX

        -> Even when games use higher-level languages, the core engine is often written in C or C++ for maximum speed.
