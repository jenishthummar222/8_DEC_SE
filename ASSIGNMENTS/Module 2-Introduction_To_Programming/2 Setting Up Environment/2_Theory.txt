            o Describe the steps to install a C compiler (e.g., GCC) and set up an Integrated 
            Development Environment (IDE) like DevC++, VS Code, or CodeBlocks. 

====================================================================================================

Step 1: Install a C Compiler (GCC)

    -> A C compiler converts C source code into executable programs. GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is the most commonly used compiler.

    ** For Windows (Using MinGW-w64)

        1] Go to the official MinGW-w64 website.

        2] Download the installer.

        3] Run the installer and select:

            -> Architecture: x86_64

            -> Threads: posix

            -> Exception: seh

        4] Install it in a folder such as:

            -> C:\mingw64
    
        5] Add GCC to the System PATH:

            -> Open Environment Variables

            -> Edit Path

            -> Add:

                -> C:\mingw64\bin


        6] Verify installation:

            -> Open Command Prompt

            -> Type:

                -> gcc --version

Step 2: Set Up an IDE

    -> An IDE provides a code editor, compiler integration, and debugging tools.

Dev-C++ :-

    ** Installation Steps **

        1] Download Dev-C++ from its official website.

        2] Run the installer.

        3] During installation:

            -> Choose TDM-GCC (compiler included)

        4] Complete installation.

    ** Usage **

        -> Open Dev-C++

        -> Go to File → New → Source File

        -> Write C code

        -> Press F9 to compile and run
