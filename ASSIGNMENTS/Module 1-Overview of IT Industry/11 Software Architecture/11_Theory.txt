** Software Architecture ** 

        -> Software architecture describes the overall structure of a software system, including its components, 
          relationships, and design principles. 
        -> A good architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and performance.

** Significance of Modularity in Software Architecture **

        -> Modularity means dividing a software system into independent and manageable modules, 
           each performing a specific function.
        
** Importance of Modularity ** 

        1. Ease of Maintenance

                Bugs can be fixed in one module without affecting others

        2. Reusability

                Modules can be reused in different projects

        3. Scalability

                Individual modules can be scaled independently

        4. Improved Testing

                Modules can be tested separately

        5. Team Productivity

                Different teams can work on different modules simultaneously
