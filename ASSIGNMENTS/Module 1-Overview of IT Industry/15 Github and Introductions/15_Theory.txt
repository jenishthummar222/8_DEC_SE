** version control **

        -> Version control is important in software development because it helps teams manage changes to code 
          efficiently, safely, and collaboratively over time.

** Key Reasons Why Version Control Is Important **

        1. Tracks Changes

                Keeps a complete history of who changed what and when

                Makes it easy to review or revert to earlier versions

        2. Supports Team Collaboration

                Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously

                Prevents overwriting each other’s work through branching and merging

        3. Enables Backup and Recovery

                Code is safely stored in repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)

                Lost or broken code can be restored quickly

        4. Improves Code Quality

                Encourages code reviews and testing before merging changes

                Helps identify bugs introduced by recent changes

        5. Manages Multiple Versions

                Allows maintaining different versions (development, testing, production)

                Useful for bug fixes and feature updates

        6. Enhances Accountability

                Every change is linked to a specific developer

                Improves transparency and responsibility

        7. Facilitates Continuous Integration

                Integrates smoothly with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
