** Three Common Application Security Vulnerabilities and Their Solutions **

    1. SQL Injection

        Description:

            Occurs when attackers insert malicious SQL queries through user input to access or manipulate a database.

            Example:

            ' OR '1'='1


        Impact:

            Unauthorized data access

            Data modification or deletion

        Solutions:

            Use prepared statements / parameterized queries

            Validate and sanitize user input

            Apply least-privilege access to databases

    2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

        Description:
        
            Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

        Impact:

            Session hijacking

            Stealing cookies and user data

        Solutions:

            Escape and encode user input/output

            Use Content Security Policy (CSP)

            Avoid inline JavaScript

    3. Broken Authentication

        Description:

            Occurs due to weak authentication mechanisms like poor password policies or session handling.

        Impact:

            Account takeover

            Unauthorized access

        Solutions:

            Enforce strong password policies

            Use multi-factor authentication (MFA)

            Implement secure session management
