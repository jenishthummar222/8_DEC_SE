Application Security :- 

        -> Application security focuses on protecting software applications from threats and attacks by identifying, 
           fixing, and preventing security vulnerabilities throughout the application’s lifecycle.


** Role of Encryption in Securing Applications **

        Encryption is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into unreadable data (ciphertext) to prevent unauthorized access.

        ** Importance of Encryption **

        1. Data Confidentiality

                Protects sensitive data such as passwords, personal information, and financial data

        2. Secure Data Transmission

                Prevents data interception during network communication (HTTPS, TLS)

        3. Data Integrity

                Ensures data is not altered during transmission

        4. Authentication

                Verifies identity using digital certificates and encrypted keys

        5. Compliance

                Helps meet security standards like GDPR, PCI-DSS
        
** Types of Encryption Used **

        -> Symmetric Encryption (AES)

        -> Asymmetric Encryption (RSA)

        -> Hashing (SHA-256)
