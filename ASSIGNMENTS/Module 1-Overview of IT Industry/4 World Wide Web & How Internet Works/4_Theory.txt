        using browsers.

** Roles of Client and Server in Web Communication **

        Client

                -> A client is a device or application that requests services or data from a server.

                -> Functions of a Client:

                -> Sends HTTP/HTTPS requests

                -> Takes user input

                -> Displays web pages

                -> Manages cookies and cache

                -> Examples: 
                        Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox), mobile apps

        Server

                -> A server is a computer system that stores, processes, and delivers web content to clients.

                -> Functions of a Server:

                -> Receives client requests

                -> Processes business logic

                -> Accesses databases

                -> Sends responses back to clients

                -> Examples: 
                        Web servers (Apache, Nginx), application servers

        Client–Server Communication Summary

                Client  → Request (HTTP/HTTPS)
                Server  → Response (Web Content)
