** Step-by-Step Explanation **

    1. The user enters a website URL in the browser.

    2. DNS (Domain Name System) converts the domain name into an IP address.

    3. The client sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server.

    4. Data is broken into packets and routed through ISPs and routers.

    5. The server processes the request.

    6. The server sends an HTTP response (HTML, CSS, images).

    7. The browser displays the web page.
