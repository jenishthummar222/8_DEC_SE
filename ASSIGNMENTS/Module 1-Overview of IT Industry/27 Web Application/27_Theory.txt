** Advantages of Web Applications Over Desktop Applications **

   1. Easy Accessibility
      -> Web applications can be accessed from anywhere using a web browser and internet connection.

   2. No Installation Required
      -> Users do not need to install software on their computers; they can use the app directly through a browser.

   3. Automatic Updates
      -> Updates are done on the server, so users always use the latest version without manual updates.

   4. Cross-Platform Compatibility
      -> Web applications work on all operating systems such as Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices.

   5. Lower Maintenance Cost
      -> Maintenance and upgrades are handled centrally, reducing cost and effort.

   6. Easy Collaboration
      -> Multiple users can work together in real time, making collaboration easier.

   7. Data Backup and Recovery
      -> Data is stored on servers or cloud, reducing the risk of data loss.
