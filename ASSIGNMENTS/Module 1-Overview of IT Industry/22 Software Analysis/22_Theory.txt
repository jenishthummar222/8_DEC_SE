** Role of Software Analysis in the Development Process **

   -> Software analysis plays a vital role in the development process by identifying and defining system 
      requirements before design and coding begin. 
      
   -> It helps understand user needs, system behavior, and constraints. 
   
   -> Proper analysis reduces errors, avoids misunderstandings, and minimizes costly changes in later stages. 
   
   -> It also provides a clear roadmap for developers, testers, and stakeholders, ensuring the final product 
      meets expectations.
