** How Flowcharts Help in Programming and System Design **

   -> Flowcharts are visual representations of algorithms, processes, or systems. 
   
   ** They help programmers and designers by:- **

      1. Clarifying Logic – Shows step-by-step flow of the program clearly.

      2. Simplifying Complex Processes – Makes it easier to understand and debug.

      3. Improving Communication – Helps team members and stakeholders understand the system.

      4. Planning Before Coding – Reduces coding errors by designing logic first.

      5. Documentation – Serves as a reference for future maintenance or upgrades.
