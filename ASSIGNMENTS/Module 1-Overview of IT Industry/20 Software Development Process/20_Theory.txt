** Main Stages of the Software Development Process **

   The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a step-by-step process used to design, develop, test, and maintain software efficiently. 

=> The main stages are:- 

   1. Requirement Analysis

      -> In this stage, user needs are gathered and analyzed. The goal is to understand what the software should do.

   2. System Design

      -> The overall structure of the software is planned, including system architecture, database design, and interfaces.

   3. Development (Coding)

      -> Programmers write the actual code based on the design specifications using suitable programming languages.

   4. Testing

      -> The software is tested to find and fix bugs. This ensures the software works correctly and meets requirements.

   5. Deployment

      -> The software is released and made available to users in a real environment.

   6. Maintenance

      -> After deployment, the software is updated to fix issues, improve performance, and add new features.
