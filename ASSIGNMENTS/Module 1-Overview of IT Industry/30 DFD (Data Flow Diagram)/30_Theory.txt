** Significance of DFDs in System Analysis **

   -> Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) are important in system analysis because they visually represent how data flows 
      through a system. 
      
   -> They help analysts understand system processes, data storage, and interactions between users and the 
      system. 
      
   -> DFDs make complex systems easy to understand, improve communication among stakeholders, and help identify 
      missing or redundant processes. 
      
   -> They also serve as a foundation for system design and development.
