What is Programming?

    Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining a set of instructions (called a program) 
    that tells a computer how to perform a specific task or solve a problem. 
    These instructions are written in a programming language such as C, Java, Python, etc.

** Key Steps Involved in the Programming Process **
------------------------------------------------------

    1. Problem Definition

        -> Clearly understand the problem to be solved

        -> Identify inputs, outputs, and constraints

    2. Analysis

        -> Break the problem into smaller parts

        -> Decide the logic and approach to solve it

    3. Algorithm Design

        -> Create a step-by-step solution

        -> Represented using algorithms or flowcharts

    4. Coding

        -> Write the algorithm using a programming language

        -> Follow proper syntax and coding standards

    5. Compilation / Interpretation

        -> Convert source code into machine-readable form

        -> Done using a compiler or interpreter

    6. Testing and Debugging

        -> Run the program to find errors

        -> Fix syntax, runtime, and logical errors

    7. Documentation

        -> Write explanations and comments

        -> Helps others understand and maintain the program

    8. Maintenance

        -> Update and improve the program over time

        -> Fix bugs and add new features
