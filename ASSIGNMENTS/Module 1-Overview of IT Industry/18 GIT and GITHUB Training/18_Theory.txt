 ** How GIT Improves Collaboration in a Software Development Team ** 

        -> GIT improves collaboration by allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously 
           without interfering with each other’s code. 
        -> Each developer can create separate branches to develop eatures or fix bugs independently. 
           GIT tracks all changes with version history, making it easy to identify 
        -> who made what changes and revert to earlier versions if needed. 
           It also helps resolve conflicts when multiple people modify the same file. 
        -> By using remote repositories like GitHub, team members can share code, review changes, and 
           collaborate efficiently from different locations.
        

        In short :

        -> GIT enables teamwork by supporting branching, version control, conflict management, and easy 
           sharing of code among developers.
