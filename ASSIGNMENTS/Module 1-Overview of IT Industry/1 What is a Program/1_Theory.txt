        o  Explain in your own words what a program is and how it functions. 

====================================================================================================   

A program is a logical sequence of instructions created to solve a problem or complete a task using a computer. 
When a program is written, it is first converted into a form the computer understands (machine code) using a compiler or interpreter. 
After that, the computer executes each instruction in order.

Programs work by taking input, processing data using logic, and producing output. 
For example:-
     a calculator program takes numbers as input, performs arithmetic operations, and displays the result. 
     In this way, programs act as a bridge between human ideas and computer operations.
