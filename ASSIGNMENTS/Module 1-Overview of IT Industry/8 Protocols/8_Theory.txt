        o      What are the differences between HTTP and HTTPS protocols ? 

================================================JK====================================================   

Protocols :-
        
        Protocols are rules and standards that define how data is transmitted and received over a network. 
        Examples:-
                 include HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, etc.


** Differences Between HTTP and HTTPS ** 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Aspect      | HTTP                        | HTTPS                              |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Full Form   | HyperText Transfer Protocol | HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure |
| Security    | Not secure                  | Secure                             |
| Encryption  | No encryption               | Uses SSL/TLS encryption            |
| Data Safety | Data can be intercepted     | Data is encrypted and safe         |
| Port Number | 80                          | 443                                |
| Use Case    | Non-sensitive data          | Sensitive data (login, banking)    |

Explanation :- 

        -> HTTP transfers data in plain text, making it vulnerable to attacks like data sniffing.

        -> HTTPS encrypts data using SSL/TLS, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

        -> Modern browsers mark HTTP sites as Not Secure, while HTTPS is trusted.
