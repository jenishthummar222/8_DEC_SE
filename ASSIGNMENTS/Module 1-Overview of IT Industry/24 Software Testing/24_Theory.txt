** Why Is Software Testing Important? **

   -> Software testing is important because it ensures that the software works correctly and meets user 
      requirements. 
      
   -> Testing helps identify bugs, errors, and missing functionality before the software is released. 4
   
   -> It improves software quality, reliability, and performance while reducing the risk of failure in 
      real-world usage. 
      
   -> Testing also saves time and cost by fixing issues early in the development process.
