** Key Elements of System Design **

   -> The key elements of system design include system architecture, data design, interface design, 
      and component design. 
      
   -> System architecture defines the overall structure and interaction between components. 
   
   -> Data design focuses on how data is stored and managed. 
   
   -> Interface design ensures smooth interaction between users and the system. 
   
   -> Component design breaks the system into smaller modules for easier development and maintenance. 
   
   -> Together, these elements ensure the system is efficient, scalable, and reliable.
