** Basic System Architecture for a Food Delivery App **

  1. Overview

    -> A food delivery app connects customers with restaurants and delivery partners through a centralized 
       platform. 
    -> The system architecture defines how different components interact to deliver this service efficiently.

  3. Description of Components

    Frontend (Mobile/Web App):
      -> Used by customers, restaurants, and delivery partners to interact with the system.

    Backend Server:
      -> Handles business logic, processes requests, and manages workflows.

    Database:
      -> Stores user data, menus, orders, and payment information.

    Payment Gateway:
      -> Processes online payments securely.

    Maps & Location Service:
      -> Helps track delivery partners and calculate routes.

    Notification Service:
      -> Sends order updates via SMS, email, or app notifications.

  4. Benefits of This Architecture

    -> Scalable and modular

    -> Easy to maintain

    -> Secure data handling

    -> Supports high user traffic
