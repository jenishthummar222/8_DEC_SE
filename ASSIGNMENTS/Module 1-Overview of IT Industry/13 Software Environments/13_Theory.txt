** Software Environments **

        A software environment refers to the setting in which software is developed, tested, and deployed. 
        Different environments ensure software runs correctly, efficiently, and safely before it reaches end users.

        => The common types of software environments are :-

                1] Development Environment – Where developers write and test code.

                2] Testing / QA Environment – Where code is tested for bugs and performance.

                3] Production Environment – The live environment where end users access the application.

** Importance of a Development Environment in Software Production **

        1. Safe Testing Space

                Developers can write and test code without affecting live users.

        2. Debugging and Experimentation

                Provides tools to find and fix errors before deployment.

        3. Version Control Integration

                Allows tracking of code changes using Git or SVN.

        4. Replicates Production Settings

                Helps developers simulate real conditions (OS, libraries, dependencies).

        5. Collaboration

                Teams can work in a shared environment to maintain consistency.

        6. Efficiency

                Streamlines coding, testing, and building processes.
