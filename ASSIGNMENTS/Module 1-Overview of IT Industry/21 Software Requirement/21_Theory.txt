** Why Is the Requirement Analysis Phase Critical in Software Development? **

   -> The requirement analysis phase is critical because it clearly defines what the software system should 
      do and what users expect from it. 
      
   -> It helps developers understand user needs, system functionality,and constraints before development begins. Proper requirement analysis reduces misunderstandings, 
      
   -> prevents costly changes later, and ensures the final software meets user expectations. 

   -> It also acts as a foundation for design, development, testing, and maintenance.
