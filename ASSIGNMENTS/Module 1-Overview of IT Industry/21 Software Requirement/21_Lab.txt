1. Introduction

  -> The Library Management System (LMS) is designed to automate and manage the day-to-day operations of 
     a library. 
  -> It helps librarians and users efficiently manage books, members, and transactions such as issuing

10. Conclusion

  -> This requirement specification defines the basic features and limitations of a simple Library Management 
     System to ensure efficient library operations.
