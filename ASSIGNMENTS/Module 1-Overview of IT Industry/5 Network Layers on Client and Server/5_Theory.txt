                        ********  THEORY EXERCISE: *********
        o    Explain the function of the TCP/IP model and its layers.

Network Layers on Client and Server

        -> Both the client and the server communicate using the same network layers. 
        -> These layers ensure that data is sent, routed, received, and understood correctly over the network. 
        -> The most widely used model for this communication is the TCP/IP model.

** TCP/IP Model and Its Layers **

        -> The TCP/IP model explains how data is transmitted over the Internet. 
        -> It consists of four layers, and each layer has a specific role.

        1. Application Layer

                Provides network services to applications

                Handles protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP

                Example: 
                        Web browser sending an HTTP request

        2. Transport Layer

                Ensures data delivery between client and server

                Uses TCP (reliable, connection-oriented) and UDP (fast, connectionless)

                Handles error checking and flow control

        3. Internet Layer

                Responsible for logical addressing and routing

                Uses IP (Internet Protocol)

                Breaks data into packets and routes them to the destination

        4. Network Access Layer

                Handles physical transmission of data

                Includes Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MAC addressing

                Converts packets into electrical or wireless signals
