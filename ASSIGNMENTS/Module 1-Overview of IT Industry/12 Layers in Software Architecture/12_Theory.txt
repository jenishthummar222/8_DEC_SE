** Layers in Software Architecture **

        -> Software architecture is often layered, where each layer has a specific role. 
        -> The most common structure for applications is the three-layer architecture:

                1. Presentation Layer (UI)

                2. Business Logic Layer (BLL)

                3. Data Access Layer (DAL)

        -> Layering improves modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

** Why Are Layers Important in Software Architecture? **

        1. Separation of Concerns

                Each layer focuses on a specific responsibility.

                Example: 
                        UI changes do not affect business logic or database.

        2. Maintainability

                Easier to update one layer without affecting others.

        3. Reusability

                Business logic or data access modules can be reused across different applications.

        4. Scalability

                Layers can be scaled independently. For example, database servers can be upgraded without changing the UI.

        5. Testability

                Layers can be tested individually for correctness.

        6. Flexibility

                Supports multiple interfaces, like web, mobile, or API clients, without changing the business logic.
