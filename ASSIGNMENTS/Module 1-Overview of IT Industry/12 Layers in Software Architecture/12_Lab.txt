Case Study: 
    
    -> Online Bookstore System

    Scenario: An online bookstore allows users to browse books, place orders, and view order history.

    1. Presentation Layer

        Functionality: 
            Handles user interaction.

        Components: 
            Web pages, mobile app interface, forms for searching books and placing orders.

        Example: 
            The user searches for a book by entering a keyword. The UI collects input and sends it to the business layer.

    2. Business Logic Layer

        Functionality: 
            Processes user requests and enforces business rules.

        Components: 
            Order processing module, discount calculation, inventory management.

        Example: 
            When a user places an order, the BLL checks inventory, calculates the total price, applies discounts, and prepares the order for storage.

    3. Data Access Layer

        Functionality: 
            Communicates with the database.

        Components: 
            SQL queries, database connections, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) modules.

        Example: 
            Saves the order details to the database and retrieves book information when requested.

    Flow Example:

        User enters book search → Presentation Layer → Business Logic Layer → Data Access Layer → Database
        Database returns book info → Data Access Layer → Business Logic Layer → Presentation Layer → User sees results
