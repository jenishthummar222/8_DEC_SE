        o         What is the difference between source code and machine code? 

================================================JK====================================================   

Source Code :- 

        -> Source code is a set of instructions written by a programmer in a high-level programming language 
           such as C, Java, or Python. 
        -> It is human-readable and must be compiled or interpreted into machine code before a computer can execute it.

Difference Between Source Code and Machine Code

| Aspect      | Source Code                                        | Machine Code                                   |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Definition  | Human-readable instructions written by programmers | Binary instructions understood by the computer |
| Language    | High-level (C, Java, Python)                       | Low-level (binary 0s and 1s)                   |
| Readability | Easy to read and modify                            | Hard for humans to read                        |
| Execution   | Must be compiled or interpreted                    | Executed directly by CPU                       |
| Portability | Can be run on different systems after compilation  | Hardware-specific                              |
| Example     | `print("Hello, World!")`                           | `10110000 01101000 01010101 ...`               |

Explanation

        Source code is written in a form humans can understand and maintain.

        Machine code is the converted form that a CPU can directly execute.

        The compiler or interpreter bridges the gap between the two.
