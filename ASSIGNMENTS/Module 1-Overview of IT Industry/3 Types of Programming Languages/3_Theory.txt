        o   What are the main differences between high-level and low-level 
            programming languages?

Types of Programming Languages

    Programming languages are generally classified based on their level of abstraction from hardware.


Differences Between High-Level and Low-Level Programming Languages
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Aspect          | High-Level Languages               | Low-Level Languages                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Definition      | Languages closer to human language | Languages closer to machine hardware |
| Ease of Use     | Easy to learn, read, and write     | Difficult to learn and write         |
| Abstraction     | High abstraction from hardware     | Very little or no abstraction        |
| Portability     | Highly portable across systems     | Machine dependent                    |
| Execution Speed | Slower than low-level              | Very fast                            |
| Memory Control  | Automatic memory management        | Direct memory access                 |
| Examples        | Python, Java, C++, JavaScript      | Assembly, Machine Language           |
