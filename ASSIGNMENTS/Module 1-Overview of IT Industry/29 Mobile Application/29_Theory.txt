** Differences Between Native and Hybrid Mobile Apps **

| Aspect                        | Native Mobile Apps                       | Hybrid Mobile Apps                     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Technology**                | Built using platform-specific languages  | Built using web technologies           |
|                               | (Java/Kotlin for Android, Swift for iOS) | (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)                |
| **Platform Support**          | Separate apps for each platform          | Single app works on multiple platforms |
| **Performance**               | High performance and smooth              | Slightly lower than native             |
| **Access to Device Features** | Full access to device hardware           | Limited or via plugins                 |
| **Development Time**          | Longer                                   | Shorter                                |
| **Development Cost**          | Higher                                   | Lower                                  |
| **UI/UX**                     | Best user experience                     | UI may feel less native                |
| **Maintenance**               | Harder (multiple codebases)              | Easier (single codebase)               |
| **Examples**                  | WhatsApp, Instagram                      | Uber, Instagram (partly hybrid)        |

In Simple Words:-

   -> Native apps are faster and feel more natural.

   -> Hybrid apps are cheaper and quicker to develop.
