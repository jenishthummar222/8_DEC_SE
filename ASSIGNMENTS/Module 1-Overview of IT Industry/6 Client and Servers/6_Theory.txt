** Client Server Communication ** 

        Client–server communication is a networking model in which a client requests services or resources, 
        and a server processes those requests and sends back responses. 
        This model is the foundation of web applications, email systems, file sharing, and many network services.

** How Client–Server Communication Works **

        1. Client Request

                The client (browser or app) sends a request to the server.

                Example: 
                        HTTP request for a web page.

        2. Network Transmission

                The request travels through network layers (TCP/IP).

                Data is broken into packets and routed across the internet.

        3. Server Processing

                The server receives the request.

                It processes logic, accesses databases, or performs computations.

        4. Server Response

                The server sends a response back to the client.

                Example: 
                        HTML page, JSON data, or file.

        5. Client Display

                The client receives the response and displays the result to the user.

** Client–Server Communication Flow **

        Client  → Request (HTTP/HTTPS)
        Server  → Processing
        Server  → Response (Data)
        Client  → Display Output
